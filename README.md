# Simulator
Here We are going to put the tasks list.. to be done
1. creating a file with the standard class.. which is going to save the registers details.
2. then we have to make a function of the program counter or add the program counter variable.
3. Then we have to add the variable that stores the linked register in the class.
4. For that we have to make a function that continuously changes the standard class registers with the program counter and the linked registers.
5. We have to debug the assembler then.
6. Then we have to copy the error checks in the assembler.
7. We might also have to make a small program that checks which reads the binary data to perform the tasks.
8. Making a function that showcast the standard class details in the graphical manner.
9. Making a function that stores the line sequence which was run in the simulator and presents it with the program counter.

Here is the list of the task done/completed
